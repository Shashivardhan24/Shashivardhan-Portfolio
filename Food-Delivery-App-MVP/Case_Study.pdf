Food-Delivery-App-MVP/Case_Study.pdf
Product Development and Launch Execution.
1. What A/B do you suggest to make it easier to find friends on Facebook?
2. Design a user research questionnaire you would ask users for your food delivery app?
Instruction:
This assignment consists of two parts. You are required to complete once case study from each section:
1. MVP Scoping: Choose any one of the two given scenarios.
2. Product Development and launch Execution: Attempt any one of the two given scenarios.
SECTION 1: MVP Scoping
Selected Case Study: Define a MVP of a Food Delivery App
Objective:
To define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a food delivery app that solves the core problem — helping users order
food from nearby restaurants quickly and reliably.
Key Features — Included in MVP:
Feature Why It’s In MVP
User Login/Signup Needed to personalize experience, manage orders, and secure payments.
Restaurant Listing Core to the app enables users to browse options based on location/cuisine.
Menu View Users need to explore dishes before ordering.
Cart & Checkout Essential transaction flow. Enables order placement.
Payment Gateway (UPI/Cards) Basic digital payment options needed for a seamless order experience.
Order Tracking (Basic) Builds user trust by showing real-time updates after payment.
Order History Useful for quick reordering and support queries.
Excluded from MVP:
Feature Why It's Not in MVP
Loyalty/Reward Points Useful for retention, but not critical for early traction.
Referral Program Good for growth, can come post-product-market fit.
Live Chat/Support Bot Start with email/help form, scale support later.
Feature Why It's Not in MVP
AI-Based Recommendations Adds complexity; best post-launch when user data exists.
Scheduled Deliveries More of a power-user feature, not needed in v1.
Focus:
Keep it simple, fast, and functional — let users browse, order, and receive food without any friction. Build loyalty and
growth features after validating core behaviour.
SECTION 2: Product Development and Launch Execution
Selected Case Study: A/B Test for Finding Friends on Facebook
Problem:
Users find it hard to discover and connect with friends after signing up.
A/B Test Ideas to Improve Friend Discovery:
1. Test 1: Contact Sync Prompt Timing
 A: Show contact sync prompt immediately after signup.
 B: Delay it until after profile setup and photo upload.
 Goal: See which timing leads to more friend connections.
2. Test 2: Mutual Friends Suggestion Format
 A: Show basic name + profile picture
 B: Show name, profile pic, mutual friends count, and common interests
 Goal: Measure click-through and add-friend conversion.
3. Test 3: Suggested Friends Placement
 A: Keep friend suggestions on the homepage
 B: Move them into a dedicated tab ("People You May Know")
 Goal: See which placement increases engagement and connections.
4. Test 4: Incentive-based Additions
 A: Normal friend suggestion
 B: Add “Add 5 friends to unlock profile themes”
 Goal: See if gamification improves discovery and retention
